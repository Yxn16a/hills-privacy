<h1>Account Deletion</h1>

<p>
Hills (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your right to control your personal data.
This page explains how you can request deletion of your Hills account.
</p>

<h2>Delete Your Account In-App</h2>
<p>
If you have access to the Hills app, you can delete your account directly:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Hills app</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Account Settings</strong></li>
  <li>Select <strong>Delete Account</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
Once confirmed, your account and associated data will be permanently deleted,
except where retention is required by law.
</p>

<h2>Delete Your Account Without App Access</h2>
<p>
If you no longer have access to the Hills app (for example, if you uninstalled it
or changed devices), you can request account deletion by contacting us:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Email:</strong> support.hillssystems@gmail.com
</p>

<p>
Please include the phone number or email address associated with your Hills account
so we can verify ownership before processing the deletion request.
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
When an account deletion request is completed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your account information will be permanently deleted</li>
  <li>Associated personal data will be removed from active systems</li>
  <li>Some data may be retained only where required for legal, security, or fraud-prevention purposes</li>
</ul>
